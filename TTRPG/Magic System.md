# Building a magic system from sort of scratch but mostly from spare parts and ill-gotten/borrowed things...

## What are the defining characteristics of a spell?
DND 5e
- Name
- Level
- School of Magic
- Range
- Area of Effect
- Casting time
- Duration
- Damage Type
- Damage Dice
- Ritual
- Concentration
- To hit
- Save
- Components (ie. material, somatic, verbal)

## What does that really mean?
- Name: The commonly used name for the spell and possibly who made it
- Level: Relative power level of the spell as compared to other spells
- School of Magic: Sort of a short hand for what type of spell and types of specialists in wizards
- Range: How far out it can effect or target
- Area of Effect: What is the shape of the spell effect
- Casting time: How long does it take to cast without a ritual
- Duration: How long it lasts
- Damage Type: As an attack spell, what is the type of injury this inflicts
- Damage Dice: Range of damage this can do and the statistical variance of said damage
- Ritual: Can this be cast by using a complex ritual and not using as much inate internal reserves (spell slots)
- Concentration: Do you need to keep your attention and will pushing this spell for it to continue
- To hit: Targeting
- Save: Can this be resisted
- Components: Outside requirements to casting this spell

## What of those are just correlative to each other? Why do these even exist?
-  Level, Range, Area of Effect, Duration, and Damage Dice are all just various details related to how powerful the spell is. Level is meant to balance gameplay by ensuring spells level in power in relation to other classes. Realistically a spell's level is a over-simplified way of determining the spell's "power". In reality this is more about combat game ballance then actual ballance in world building. There are spells that are situationally more powerful than higher level spells. And there are spells that have the ability to break the worldbuild even though they are low level spells. 
- Damage Type is a category that ultimately is only flavor text unless the target has resistances or vulnerabilities to that damage type. Even in non-magical examples this concept hold true. The overal mechanical difference between taking 1d8 damage from a club or 1d8 damage from a sword is purely narrative unless the target is resistant or vulnerable to that damage type. Thus, game balance in combat should account for this. The damage type should make more of a difference in all combat other than narrative flavor. Fire should burn, catch flamable things on fire, raise the temperature of the room, and cause the room to increase in light level. Ice should trap things, slow things down, make them slippery, drop the temperature of the room, and cause things to get wet as it melts and as condensation occurs. Video games do similar things by having different damage types have follow on mechanics that affect the game play beyond the animation.
- Concentration is just a limiter on what you can do while that spell is active and a limiter on having multiple of that type of spell cast at once. Is this that big of a problem or unballancer? What else could this do instead? Make a spell last longer than its duration? Make the spell have a persistent or longer than one action ability?
- Casting time and ritual are both limiters for combat purposes. Why are there spells that take more than one action that are not ritual spells? Why would someone use up a limited resource like a spell slot on something that would only take them 10 minutes to do anyway. Is non-combat time that percise or tracked?
