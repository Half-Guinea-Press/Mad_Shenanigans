The Systems Engineering Plan (SEP) is a living document that details the execution, management, and control of the technical aspects of an acquisition program from conception to disposal. The SEP outlines how the systems engineering process is applied and tailored to meet objectives for each acquisition phase. The SEP captures a programâ€™s current and evolving systems engineering strategy and its relationship with the overall program management effort. The SEP should include the process and criteria for updating the document.
