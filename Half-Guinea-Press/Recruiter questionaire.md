1. What's prompting your current job search? What would captivate your interest in regards to a new role? (please be informative/not vague:-)  

My current position on contract is coming to a close.

In regards to new roles and opportunities, I am looking for positions that are challenging and are hands on with new technologies and how those technologies exist inside of the current operational ecosystem.  It is great to get to see things get designed, developed, implemented, and then used in the real world. 

I enjoy getting to work with the developers, engineers, and coders as well as the users and leadership. I have always found that getting perspective from the range of people that will be working with the technologies gives better insight into what the project ultimately needs to be. 

I enjoy learning and research. I don't like it when I run into something that I don't know, whether that is a new concept, rules and policies, new use case etc.When I run into things like that I enjoy chasing down the information and applying it to the project.

I am interested in developing work processes and finding better ways to increase both the effectiveness and efficiency of the process. I enjoy doing this both in technology but also in standard operating procedures. 

2. Have you been submitted against any specific contracts as of right now? IF SO, please provide me with the details...i.e. last week you were submitted to the "X" Contract. This info will help me avoid the "double submission" scenario.  

I am currently on the ESEA II contract as a sub under Peraton as the prime. I have not been submitted as of now to any contracts. I do have some initial conversation meetings set up with a few companies early next week. 

3. What ANNUAL percentage of CONUS travel can you perform (IF it's a requirement for the position)?  
i.e. 5% LOCAL, 25% CONUS/OCONUS  

10% Local, 25% CONUS/OCONUS but I am flexible depending on the position.

4. Which levels of clearance are REQUIRED for your job?  
Secret, Top-secret (TS), TS/SCI, TS/SCI/CI poly, TS/SCI/NSA FSP  
If there are any levels of clearance which you hold but are NOT currently REQUIRED, please let me know the mo/yr it was LAST NEEDED.  
i.e. current role requires a TS/SCI, and the FSP was last needed in 2021.  

My current role requires a TS/SCI/NSA FSP. 
  
5. Which cities/towns in MD are doable? (fyi, 75% of their work on the MD side is either on Ft. Meade or Annap Jct).  

I am able to work anywhere in Maryland. 
  
6. All our clients have very comprehensive benefits and offer other forms of compensation....i.e. PTO, health insurance, 401K/MATCH, 10 or 11 days of holiday pay, floating holidays, possible some sort of bonus(es), etc... this will add in an additional 10-20+K in compensation.....).Â   
With this in mind, what 10K BASE SALARY RANGE will you consider?

My current salary is $175,000 and would like to stay at or above that range.
